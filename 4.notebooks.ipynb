    "### Extreme Imbalance:\n",
    "* **Evidence:** The DELUX customer segment accounts for **99.61%** of the total customer file, while the VIP segment represents only **0.04%** (2 customers).\n",
    "* **Insight:** The business model operates almost entirely on a low-value/high-churn risk customer base. The revenue risk is **extreme** if the 2 VIP customers cease transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dormancy Risk:\n",
    "* **Evidence:** The average Recency (R) for DELUX customers is **201 days**.\n",
    "* **Insight:** Most customers have not made a purchase in over 6.5 months. This signals a **customer retention crisis** and necessitates urgent \"Win-back\" campaigns."

    "### 2.1. VIP Segment (0.04% - Critically Important)\n",
    "* **Evidence (F):** VIP customers have an average purchase Frequency (F) of **344 times**, which is **63.7 times higher** than the DELUX group (5.4 times).\n",
    "* **Evidence (M):** The average Monetary Value (M) is **$115,895.60**, which is **79 times higher** than DELUX ($1,465.39).\n",
    "* **Insight (Action):** This group is the **Lifeblood** of the business. All strategies must focus on maintaining maximum Recency ($\\text{R}=1$ day) through **Personalized Premium Service** to ensure zero friction in their purchasing journey."

    "* **Evidence (R):** This segment exhibits good Recency (R) at **24 days**.\n",
    "* **Evidence (F):** The purchase Frequency (F) is **109 times**, which is **20 times higher** than the DELUX group (5.4 times).\n",
    "* **Insight (Action):** This is the **Growth Pool** and should be treated as the next generation of VIPs. Implement **Upsell/Cross-sell** strategies via high-value product bundles, aiming to increase their average Monetary Value ($\\text{M}$) above the $50,000$ threshold to transition this group to VIP status."

    "* **Evidence (R & F):** This group has a poor average Recency (R) of **201 days**, with low purchase Frequency (F) at only 5.4 times.\n",
    "* **Evidence (M):** Average spending is low, at **$1,465.39**.\n",
    "* **Insight (Action):** Using mass marketing budgets on this group is **wasteful**. Focus on **Re-segmentation** within the DELUX group based on their last known Recency. Run **Low-Cost Nudges** (e.g., reminder emails, free shipping offers) to activate a small fraction of the segment, accepting that the majority may be permanently lost."
